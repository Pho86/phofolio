## Project Brief
LocalToMe is a web application that locates and provides low-income families/individuals with free & accessible food resources near their area within their budgets. To accomplish this project, I collaborated with 5 other members, 3 developers and 2 designers from BCIT’s Full Stack Web Development and Digital Design and Development.

## The Process
Throughout this project, we had to figure out what underprivileged people actually wanted and how we would help them. To do so, we tried to contact food banks themselves, but they were unresponsive and tried to look into webscraping, but deemed that out of scope. Then we found a public API that sourced out all of the free, low cost programs in downtown Vancouver.

## Challenges and Outcome
A challenge I faced, was this project was the first time I was worked with using data from an actual database (Firebase), and had to figure out how to grab data and incorporate it into our designs. During the project, I focused on scripting reusable components for the front-end, helped designing the prototype, and creating responsive web design. Furthermore, developed a documentation and organization system for the components that team members would follow when scripting components.
<br/>
In the end, we were able to successfully build a fully functional web application and present our project to industry experts and over 100 people.
