## Project Brief
Genshinfy is a music player web application that allows people to upload and listen to music, mainly from the game Genshin Impact. Developed the application as an individual as a solo project to explore using the framework Nuxt 3/Vue Js.

## The Process
To explore Nuxt 3 and Vue JS, I created a music application that allows users to upload and listen to music with Firebase. After the music is fetched from the Firebase database, it is then played through the web browser using Howler Js, in a store made by Pinia, which allows the user to play music continuously as they traverse through each page.

## Challenges and Outcome
Due to this project being my first solo full-stack web application that I've worked on and the first time I used Vue and Typescript for a project. I had to learn how to script components using Vue and using Typescript to declare types. The project still has many features I would like to add, if given more time to do so, such as:

* Improve micro interactions
* Allow users to create playlists and share links to other users
* Search functionality
* Music Player Settings (fade-in/out, better loop control, speeds
* Next/Back buttons to control music queue
* Music Queue Page to display current queue
* Display what current song is playing by highlighting current song
* Music thumbnails

In the end, I was able to successfully build a fully functional web application that can be used to listen and upload your own and others music. I look forward to coding more things using Typescript and Vue if given the opportunity to do so.
