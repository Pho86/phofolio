## Project Brief
ShareFood is a web application that has the goal to save food by sharing it with others; whether, it be receiving or giving away leftover foods. It tells you details about the food and has many fun stories to explore.

## The Process
During the project, I focused on scripting functionalities of the application and creating mock databases (in JSON files), and would handle any Git conflicts and merges during the project. For the main functionality with the JSON files, I would loop through the JSON file and map it out based off the query.

## Challenges and Outcome
Something I would do in the future if given the opportunity would be organizing the components in actual folders, near the end of the project as we kept on building components, it was hard to tell which component was actually which. Thus leading to our group having to check every component file to find the actual component we had. An example of this was in the Button.js folder, where we would have 8 different button components in 1 file. 
<br/>
In the end, we were able to successfully build a fully functional web application and present our project to a room of over 50+ people.
