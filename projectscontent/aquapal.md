## The Process
For AquaPal, we wanted drinking water we wanted to create a web application that made drinking your water fun. To do so, we had people design and draw animals that you could call your pet. For our backend, we used SQLite, express, and used axios to post data whenever the user inputted that they drank water. Afterwards, we used EJS to parse and display the amount on the screen with the design so users can have a seamless experience.

## Challenges and Outcome
A challenge I faced, was this was the first project I've using SQLite3 and EJS. I had to learn how to post and fetch data from the SQLite database and struggled during that time. It took time because I kept mixing strings and numbers together, which would create NaN errors because I would receive strings from inputs/selects and did not realize that. 

In the end, we were able to successfully build a fully functional web application that can be used to keep track of your water drinking goals.
